    "After running several prompts, it looks like the model is good at not only creating an SQL query for all but one prompt, but also good at translating back its findings and explaining the SQL query in human language. It takes a human input, and creates a technical output with a human explanation, which is very impressive. The only prompt it failed in was \"which patients still have not paid for their treatment?\", in which in provided instructions for the users to create the query themself but provided no query, which is strange because the instructions for how to build the query are correct, and that means that the model was able to translate the process, using its own words and yet did not understand the task of building the query. It took the question, understood it by putting a solution into instructive language of its own, which means it had an \"idea\" of what was being asked, and yet did not produce the query itself. This is interesting as I cannot understand what the limitation was that it hit. When using the precise language of the table \"which patients still have an outstanding balance?\" for the same question, it produces the summary and query as asked. So the the limit appears to have just been the use of synonyms, but again it's strange because it converted the synonym I used for balance \"have not paid\" into instructions about the balance."
